# Simple Chatbot with Learning Capabilities

This is a simple chatbot implemented in Python using the Keras library for natural language processing. The chatbot is capable of engaging in conversations with users and learning from their feedback to improve its responses over time.

## Features

- Responds to user input based on predefined responses.
- Learns from user feedback to adapt and improve its responses.
- Uses a neural network model for text classification.
- Supports training on custom datasets.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10
- Keras

- Install dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install keras

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/H3nryK/Learning-Bot.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd Learning-Bot

3. Run the chatbot script:

    ```bash
    py tensor.py

4. Interact with the chatbot by typing messages in the console. Type 'exit' to end the conversation.

## Customization

- Modify the responses dictionary in chatbot.py to customize the chatbot's responses.
- Train the model on custom datasets by providing input texts and corresponding labels.
- Experiment with different neural network architectures and hyperparameters for better performance.
